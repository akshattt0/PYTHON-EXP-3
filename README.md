## Title

Lists in Python: Indexing, Slicing, and List Methods

---

## Aim

To study the list data structure in Python and perform various operations such as indexing, slicing, traversal, and the use of built-in list methods.

---

## Objectives

- To create lists and access their elements  
- To perform indexing and slicing operations on lists  
- To apply commonly used list methods  
- To understand the mutable nature of lists  
- To perform traversal and modification of list elements

## Theory

### Introduction to Lists

A list is a built-in, flexible data structure in Python that allows multiple values to be stored within a single variable. Lists are defined using square brackets `[ ]`, with elements separated by commas. Due to their dynamic nature, lists are widely used for data storage and manipulation.

---

### Features of Python Lists

- **Ordered**: Elements retain the order in which they are added  
- **Indexed**: Each element has an index starting from `0`  
- **Mutable**: Values can be modified after creation  
- **Heterogeneous**: Elements of different data types can be stored together  
- **Duplicate Values Allowed**: Same elements can appear multiple times  

---

### Creating Lists

Lists can be created in multiple ways:
- Using square brackets  
- Using the `list()` constructor  

Lists can also be nested, meaning a list can contain another list as its element.

---

### Indexing in Lists

Indexing is used to access individual elements of a list.

- **Positive Indexing**: Starts from `0` and moves left to right  
- **Negative Indexing**: Starts from `-1` and moves right to left  

This allows flexible access to list elements from both ends.

---

### Slicing in Lists

Slicing extracts a subset of elements from a list without modifying the original list.

**Syntax:**
list_name[start : end : step]

Where:
- `start` indicates the starting index (included)  
- `end` indicates the ending index (excluded)  
- `step` specifies the interval between elements  

Different slicing techniques include beginning slice, ending slice, and full slice.

---

### Mutability of Lists

Lists are mutable data structures, allowing changes after creation. Due to mutability, the following operations are possible:
- Updating existing elements  
- Adding new elements  
- Removing elements  

This property makes lists ideal for handling changing data.

---

### List Traversal

Traversal refers to accessing each element of a list one at a time. It can be done using:
- `for` loop  
- `while` loop  

Traversal is commonly used for searching, analyzing, and processing list data.

---

### List Methods

Python provides several built-in methods for list manipulation:

| Method | Description |
|------|------------|
| `append()` | Adds an element at the end |
| `insert()` | Inserts element at a specified position |
| `remove()` | Removes a specified element |
| `pop()` | Removes an element using index |
| `sort()` | Sorts the list |
| `reverse()` | Reverses the list |
| `clear()` | Removes all elements |
| `count()` | Counts occurrences of an element |
| `index()` | Returns index of an element |

---

### Built-in Functions for Lists

| Function | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| `len()` | Returns number of elements |
| `max()` | Returns maximum value |
| `min()` | Returns minimum value |
| `sum()` | Returns sum of numeric elements |

## Conclusion

Thus, Python lists and their operations were studied in detail. This experiment provided practical understanding of list creation, indexing, slicing, traversal, mutability, and the use of built-in methods and functions for effective data management.
