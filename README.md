# Experiment 3: Python Lists

---

## Aim

To study and implement list data structures in Python and perform various operations such as accessing elements, slicing, and using built-in list methods.

---

## Objectives

- To understand the concept of lists in Python  
- To create lists containing different types of elements  
- To access list elements using indexing and negative indexing  
- To perform list slicing operations  
- To modify lists by adding, inserting, and removing elements  
- To apply built-in list functions for solving basic problems

## Theory

A list in Python is a collection data type used to store multiple values in a single variable. Lists are ordered, mutable, and can store elements of different data types such as integers, strings, booleans, and complex numbers.

Elements in a list can be accessed using indexing, where indexing starts from `0`. Python also supports negative indexing, which allows access to elements from the end of the list. Slicing is used to extract a portion of a list by specifying a range of indices.

Python provides several built-in methods to manipulate lists. The `append()` method is used to add elements at the end of a list, while `insert()` adds elements at a specified position. The `remove()` method deletes a particular element from the list. Lists can be extended using the `extend()` method.

Basic operations such as finding the maximum, minimum, sum, and average of numeric list elements can be performed using built-in functions like `max()`, `min()`, `sum()`, and `len()`. Lists can also be sorted in ascending order using the `sort()` method.

These features make lists a powerful and flexible data structure for organizing and processing data in Python programs.

## Conclusion

Thus, Python lists and their operations were studied and implemented successfully. This experiment helped in understanding list creation, indexing, slicing, and the use of various list methods for solving real-life programming problems.
